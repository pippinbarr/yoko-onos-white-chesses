# Ideas

## "Standard"

All white pieces but legal moves enforced?
(All white pieces visually but actually still black and white?)

## "All together now"
All white pieces visually and conceptually so can't take each other
(Does this affect what each piece thinks is forward?)

## "Flipflop"
White pieces can convert to black pieces (and back again?)

(At either end of the board?)
(Do these become active pieces that can take other pieces?)
(Is there another mechanism that enables white pieces to convert to black pices over time?)

## "King of the castle"
(Instead of checkmating the king, the goal is for the king to castle with the opponent's castle)
(Castles probably not allowed to move)
(This is silly and probably impossible)
